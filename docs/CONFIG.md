# Config

Run:

```bash
tedge init
```

This creates:

```text
.tomorrowedge/config.yaml
```

The default config enables safe mode, disables telemetry, and leaves cloud providers off unless configured.

Local learned task memory is stored in `.tomorrowedge/task-memory.jsonl` after
sessions are saved. It records compact metadata only: task type, risk level,
routing mode, verification commands, visual page type, judge decision, and
result. It does not store file contents or long model outputs.
